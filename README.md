# Huggingface Sentiment Test

This is designed to be a test project to test the performance of out-of-the-box transformers. The model is stored here 
in the project to decrease startup time when running in the cloud but i can't store those large of files in my github...

Env vars:
- ITERATIONS = how many iterations to run (default 25)
- NUMBER_SENTENCES = how many sentences per iteration (default 100)
